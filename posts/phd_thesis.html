<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are search algorithms inspired by genetics and
natural selection, and have been used to solve difficult problems in many
disciplines, including modelling, control systems and automation. GAs are
generally able to find good solutions in reasonable time, however as they are
applied to larger and harder problems they are very demanding in terms of
computation time and memory.
</p>

<p>
The Internet is the most powerful parallel and distributed computation
environment in the world, and the idle cycles and memories of computers on
the Internet have been increasingly recognized as a huge untapped source of
computation power. By combining Internet computing and GAs, this dissertation
provides a framework for Internet-based parallel and distributed GAs that
gives scientists and engineers an easy and affordable way to solve hard real
world problems.
</p>

<p>
Developing parallel computation applications on the Internet is quite unlike
developing applications in traditional parallel computation environments, such
as multiprocessor systems and clusters. This is because the Internet is
different in many respects, such as communication overhead, heterogeneity
and volatility. To develop an Internet-based GA, we need to understand the
implication of these differences. For this purpose, a convergence model
for heterogenous and volatile networks is presented and used in experiments
that study GA performance and robustness in Internet-like scenarios. The
main outcome of this research is an Internet-based distributed GA framework
called G2DGA.
</p>

<p>
G2DGA is an island model distributed GA, which can provide support for
big populations needed to solve many real world problems. G2DGA uses a novel
hybrid peer-to-peer (P2P) design with island node activity coordinated by
supervisor nodes that offer a global overview of the GA search state.
Compared to client/server approaches, the P2P architecture improves
scalability and fault tolerance by allowing direct communication between the
islands and avoiding single-point-of-failure situations.
